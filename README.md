## Q\&A

### Installation & Compatibility

#### How does it work?

The package contains all the necessary elements for the majority of preset collections to work as intended by their respective creators in the most common usage scenarios; some community contributions like `FFKeepUI` were added, while some default ReShade shaders were renamed or removed to avoid conflicts.

#### I have ReShade (or other ReShade-based injectors like GShade) already installed. How should I proceed?

You can rename your pre-existing `reshade-shaders` and `reshade-presets` folders to something else prior to deploying GPosingway; this way you can switch between GPosingway and your previous collection. There are **no guarantees** that GPosingway will work with different ReShade versions, however.

### Preset Usage

#### Can I use `[Insert preset collection name here]` with GPosingway?

Absolutely! The only thing to keep in mind is that *you don't need to use bundled shaders anymore*, so just ignore any instructions to copy `.fx` and `.fxh` files to the `reshade-shaders\shaders` folder; GPosingway should have everything that most presets need to avoid conflicts.

### Troubleshooting

#### Help! I can't find the `[Insert shader collection name here]` shaders!

Redistribution is strictly forbidden for some shader collections, like [iMMERSE](https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE/blob/main/LICENSE); in most cases you can download and install these with minimal issues, but your experience may differ.

### Future Plans

#### Are there plans to support newer ReShade versions in the future?

Yes, the plan is to support newer ReShade versions in future updates, but in a different format fully compatible with the ReShade installation tool; this version is meant as a starting point.
