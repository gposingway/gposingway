# Witchs Presets For Reshade
A repository for the Witch Presets for FFXIV Reshade (And any fork).
This is a backup of all of my presets, including a preset I never committed to gshade (I never felt like it was finished. Faefolk'sGlare has also been renamed to Witch'sFae, to keep with the naming scheme. These should work on all forks of reshade, they have been tested on the latest version of reshade as of this readme file, version 5.6.0, which was released on January 15th 2023.
